Single-shot image deblurring in a low-light condition is known to be a profoundly challenging image translation
task. This study tackles the limitations of the low-light image deblurring with a learning-based approach
and proposes a novel deep network named as DarkDeblurNet. The proposed DarkDeblur- Net comprises
a dense-attention block and a contextual gating mechanism in a feature pyramid structure to leverage
content awareness. The model additionally incorporates a multi-term objective function to perceive a plausible
perceptual image quality while performing image deblurring in the low-light settings. The practicability of the
proposed model has been verified by fusing it in numerous computer vision applications. Apart from that, this
study introduces a benchmark dataset collected with actual hardware to assess the low-light image deblurring
methods in a real-world setup. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can outperform
the state-of-the-art methods in both synthesized and real-world data for single-shot image deblurring, even in
challenging lighting environments.
